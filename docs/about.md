## 🎯 Purpose and Goals

Data Science lies at the intersection of **mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise**.  
This textbook aims to:

- Build **conceptual clarity** in core Data Science principles.  
- Provide **hands-on examples** in Python that can be run and modified locally.  
- Serve as a **teaching companion** for undergraduate or postgraduate Data Science courses.  
- Promote **open access and reproducibility** in data-driven research and learning.

> The content is organized to align with academic curricula while remaining accessible for independent learners.
