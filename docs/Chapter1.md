## 1. Relation among AI, ML, and Data Science

### Conceptual Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broadest field, aiming to create systems capable of intelligent behavior.  

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that learn patterns from data.  
Data Science (DS) integrates **statistics**, **data analysis**, and **ML** to extract insights and build predictive models.

The hierarchical relationship can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Data Science} \subseteq (\text{Machine Learning}) \subseteq (\text{Artificial Intelligence}) \]

This relationship is visualized as follows:

### Mathematical View
Data Science involves modeling real-world processes mathematically:

\[ Y = f(X) + \varepsilon \]

Where:  
- \(X\) = Input features or observed data  
- \(Y\) = Target variable or output  
- \(f(X)\) = Learned function (model)  
- \(\varepsilon\) = Random noise or error term

**Example:** 
Predicting house prices â€” \( Y = f(\text{area, rooms, location}) + \varepsilon \)

## 2. Evolution of Data Science

The discipline evolved through several key phases, blending statistics, computing, and AI:

| Era | Focus | Key Development |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **1950s** | Artificial Intelligence | Symbolic reasoning, rule-based systems |
| **1980s** | Machine Learning | Statistical learning, neural networks |
| **2010s** | Deep Learning | GPU-driven deep neural networks |
| **2020s** | Data Science | Unified approach: data + ML + domain knowledge |
