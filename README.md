## 🧭 Overview

This repository contains a structured, chapter-wise introduction to **Data Science** concepts, integrating:

- **Mathematical foundations** — equations rendered via MathJax  
- **Visual explanations** — plots, charts, and conceptual diagrams  
- **Hands-on Python** — reproducible code for every figure  
- **Self-contained Markdown chapters** — ideal for MkDocs Material  

Each chapter includes theory, worked examples (by hand), and Python scripts that generate all corresponding visualizations.

Would you like me to also generate a small **`docs/contributing.md`** (with setup steps and style conventions for new contributors)? It fits naturally with this README and MkDocs navigation.
